<h1>Instructions for the Blue Vs Gray Tracker</h1>

<p>This program tracks city occupation and supply points for the
<i>Blue vs Gray</i> card game.  This facilitates 
play-by-email games by providing an easy way to track and exchange
the current state of the game.

<p>If you're not familiar with <i>Blue vs Gray</i>, this page
won't make a lot of sense.  Visit the <a href="http://www.gmtgames.com/nnbg/main.html">GMT Games</a>
page and get the game already!

<p>The bulk of the display is a map of the playing surface.  Inactive
map cards are dimmed.  Use the buttons under the <i>MAP CARDS</i>
header to activate the correspondingly-lettered map card.  Blue buttons
activate USA cards, gray buttons activate Neutral cards, and gold
buttons activate CSA cards.

<p>The connections between the cities work a little differently here than they do in
the game.  Here, a dotted line is used to show connections which may be used for supply
but not for attack.  (The game uses dotted lines to make a meaningless
distinction between roads and railroads.)

<p>To change the ownership of a city, click on it, then use the
buttons under the <i>SELECTED CITY</i> header to set the
ownership.  (The buttons won't appear until a city is actually selected.)

<p>Track supply points by entering the appropriate numbers into the
<i>SUPPLY</i> section.  A maximum of 15 points can be tracked. (If you need
anywhere near that, you're probably not playing correctly.)

<p>Track the location of naval squadrons using the <i>Naval Squadrons</i>
section.  While it's technically possible to put 4 squadrons into a theater,
it's functionally meaningless (as the fourth squadron, <i>Monitor</i>, has
no strength) so use 3 instead.

<p>As you make changes to the display, the text area below the map will show
changes in city ownership and achievement of each side's game objectives automatically.

<p>The <I>GAME STATE</i> control at the top left of the screen contains a code which
stores the entire state of the game -- map cards, cities, naval squadrons, and supplies.
This code will change as you make adjustments to the display.  At any point, you can "bookmark"
the current game situation by saving that control code someplace convenient
(say, in an <a href="http://www.warhorsesim.com/acts">ACTS</a> log at the end of each turn).

<p>To return to your saved game state, copy the code back into the <i>GAME STATE</i>
control, and click <i>Load</i>.  You can then continue with your game.

<p>Click <i>Reset</i> to return the map to its game start settings.
